Frédéric Meslin alias Marzac or MarzacDev

I would like to thank personally all the users who gave me feedback for
this project, by reporting bugs, asking for new functionalities and so.

I also want to great all the people who participate directly or indirectly
in the promotion of this software on forums, Youtube and synthesizer related
websites.

And at last, the generous users who gave me little money for the project
advancement, they have their dedicated page on the sourceforge website, in the
donate section.

Frédéric
